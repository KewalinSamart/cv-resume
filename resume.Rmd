  "For instance, I've trained models that predict genes associated with antibiotic resistant in microbial pathogens and models that predict plant viruses' hosts.
  I've also been maintaining and upgrading a 
  protein analysis app (http://jravilab.org/molevolvr/?r=&p=home) built with the 
  R shiny framework which uses a PBS Torque scheduler on the backend to handle job submissions.
  Using Git, Docker, virtual environments, and pre-commit with linters, I try to ensure my code is reproducible and readable. 
  I've been using Linux-based OSs for over 3 years, and through work I've 
  spent a good amount of time assisting undergrads and grad students in working 
  from the command line including multiple in-person and remote workshops."
